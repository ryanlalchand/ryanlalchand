# Hi, I'm Ryan!

Right now, I'm doing freelance while I search for my first software engineering job. I'm also gearing up to move to State College, PA with my partner.

My current project is the Code Youngstown [website redesign](https://github.com/codeyoungstown/next-codeyoungstown.com) in Next.js and Tailwind.

While I was at YSU, I directed [HackYSU 2021 & 2022](https://hackysu.com) and I was the VP of the [YSU Computer Club](https://ysucomputerclub.com), and I look forward to supporting the new officers as an alumnus.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ryanlalchand)!
