# Hi, I'm Ryan!

Right now, I'm building out my personal website before I begin the search for my first software engineering job. I'm also gearing up to move to State College, PA with my partner. 

While I was at YSU, I directed [HackYSU 2021 & 2022](https://hackysu.com) and I was the VP of the [YSU Computer Club](https://ysucomputerclub.com), and I look forward to supporting the new officers as an alumnus.
